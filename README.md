# Bike Sales Analysis

## Problem Statement
Understanding customer demographics and behaviors is crucial for businesses to improve sales and marketing strategies. This project analyzes a dataset of bike purchases to identify key trends, including:
- Age distribution of customers purchasing bikes.
- Impact of education level, marital status, and homeownership on bike purchases.
- Regional differences in bike purchases.
- Distance traveled in relation to bike ownership.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset consists of **1,000 customers**, including details on:
- **Demographics:** Age, income, marital status, education level, number of children.
- **Purchase behavior:** Whether a customer owns a bike.
- **Geographical information:** Region of residence.
- **Other factors:** Homeownership status, commuting distance, and mode of transportation.

## Key Insights & Findings
1. **Age & Bike Purchases**
   - The majority of bike purchases occur within the age range of **36-42 years**.
   - A declining trend is observed after 42 years.

2. **Gender Distribution**
   - The dataset shows an almost equal split between male and female bike purchasers (**51% Female, 49% Male**).

3. **Education Level & Bike Ownership**
   - Individuals with a **bachelor's degree** have the highest percentage of bike purchases.
   - High school graduates show a lower tendency to own bikes.

4. **Geographical Distribution**
   - North America has the highest number of bike purchases compared to Europe and the Pacific region.

5. **Marital Status & Bike Purchases**
   - **Married individuals** have a higher likelihood of owning bikes compared to single individuals (**54% Married, 46% Single**).

6. **Home Ownership & Bike Purchases**
   - Homeowners are more likely to own bikes than renters.

7. **Average Distance Traveled**
   - People who travel longer distances tend to own bikes.
